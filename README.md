Conducted penetration testing, vulnerability assessments, and applied security principles like encryption and secure API handling to ensure the app met industry standards for mobile security.

    User Authentication: Secure user authentication ensures privacy and personalized messaging experiences.
    
    Easy-to-Use Interface: A minimalist design focusing on ease of use, providing a clutter-free environment for users to chat.
    
    Extensibility: The application is built with scalability in mind, making it easy to add more features such as group chats, multimedia sharing, or notifications.
